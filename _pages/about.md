Healthcare Actuary on the Data Technology and Analytics Team at Mercer in San Francisco. Pursuing the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) degree at UC Berkeley (evenings and weekends).

My current role involves healthcare analytics, medical risk scoring, medical claim forecasting, and applying machine learning models to segment employer populations. Past experience in applying ARIMA models to forecast seasonal insurance metrics, and utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques to produce marketing insights.

I grew up in both California and Utah, but I have also spent time living in Brazil and Portugal where I learned to speak Portuguese fluently. When I'm away from my desk, I enjoy surfing, running, and hiking around the San Francisco Bay Area.
