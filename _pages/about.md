I'm an actuarial analyst working in the health industry. Through work and other projects, I have developed skills in machine learning, data visualization, financial forecasting, and trend analysis. I grew up in both California and Utah, but I have also spent time living in Brazil and Portugal where I learned to speak Portuguese fluently. When I'm not studying for actuarial exams, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, photography, and watching TV shows like Seinfeld.
