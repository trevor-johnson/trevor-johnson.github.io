<h3>Microsoft Program Usage Analysis</h3>

Over the summer of 2017, I worked for a data analytics company, Jonathan Tooley Associates, located in Portugal. While there, I worked with a team to prepare a presentation to win a project bid with Microsoft. The task was to analyze program usage data collected from various companies. 

Using Excel, R, and Shiny I built an interactive data dashboard to explore the data. The data dashboard features interactive bar charts, regression analysis, clustering algorithms, apriori association rules analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. 

My web dashboard as well as other analyses done by my colleagues were presented to the client, Microsoft, and won the project bid. The link to the web application I created is below. The program names are hidden for confidentiality reasons.
